Hello and welcome to *FRAGMENT MISSING*
This is a calculator of sorts which is designed to 
handle matrices and common operations that can be performed on them.

It takes input in the following form
<operation> <matrix> <optional matrix>

Matrices are represented as nested brackets
[ [...] [...] ... [...] ]
Where each sub-bracket is a row in the matrix.
Because of this the number of elements 
in each sub-bracket has to be the same.
A 3x3 matrix in this representation would for example be
[[1 2 3] [4 5 6][7 8 9]]
This is equal to the matrix
 1	2	3
 4	5	6
 7	8	9

List of valid operations:
add <x> <y>
multiply <x> <y>
determinant <x>
gauss <x>
invert <x>
